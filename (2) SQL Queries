I tried to compelte two SQL Queries using MySql as a database. I tried doing the  no.3 and 4 queries present in the exercise.  

(3)
Select 
Case when (Select Avg(totalSpent) from receipts where rewardsReceiptStatus='Accepted') > (Select Avg(totalSpent) from receipts where rewardsReceiptStatus='Rejected') then 'Accepted has higher average spent'
Else 'Rejected has higher average spent'
End
From receipts

(4)
Select 
Case when (Select Sum(purchasedItemCount) from receipts where rewardsReceiptStatus='Accepted') > (Select Sum(purchasedItemCount) from receipts where rewardsReceiptStatus='Rejected') then 'Accepted has higher count'
Else 'Rejected has higher count'
End
From receipts
